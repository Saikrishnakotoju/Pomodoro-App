# Pomodoro Timer App

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer app! This project, learned from the **Codédex** platform, helps you manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique — working in focused intervals of 25 minutes followed by short breaks. This simple app was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?
The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, is a time management method that breaks work into short, focused intervals called "pomodoros" (typically 25 minutes), separated by short breaks. This method helps improve concentration, reduce burnout, and boost productivity. I learned to implement this technique through a tutorial on the **Codédex** platform.

## Features
- Timer set to 25 minutes by default
- Start, Pause, and Stop controls
- Bell sound alert when timer ends
- Stylish circular timer UI
- Responsive and simple design
All concepts and code structure were inspired and adapted from a **Codédex** tutorial.

## File Structure
pomodoro-app/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── app.js
├── sounds/
│ └── bell.wav # Sound played at end of timer


## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click the **Start** button to begin the 25-minute timer.
3. Use **Pause** to pause the timer anytime.
4. Use **Stop** to reset the timer back to 25:00.
5. When the timer reaches zero, a bell sound will alert you.
This app’s functionality and controls follow the pattern taught on **Codédex**.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
All learned and applied through the **Codédex** platform.

## Background Style
The app uses a smooth vertical gradient background from a dark teal to deep blue shade for a calming and focused visual experience.
